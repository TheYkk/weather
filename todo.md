Write a laravel application that lets users signup via their Google account and
select their cities. 


Then at users time of choice send them daily emails about
forecast in their city. Use any weather api that you find convenient and cache
results you get from that api.(eg. if 2 users are in the same city, make only one
api request). Use any queue system you find convenient to run long running tasks
such as sending emails or fetching weather data. Also briefly explain how would
you set up such project on production.
